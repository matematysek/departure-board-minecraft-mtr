# departure-board

Departure board is a JavaScript/CSS3 implementation of a rail station departure board.
Feel free to fork, suggest, offer contributions or help, but most importantly have fun!

## Usage
In the html file set what do you want to be shown on the frrst line and after how many ms it will be gone. Also you should set an cycle duration (also in ms)
Place 4 of https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/webdisplays (or fork) screens next to each other and activate it.
Run the webpage on a server, IIS in WIN 10/11 will be good too.
Open ingame in the screen the IP you ran the page at.
Enjoy.
NOTICE: The board starts showing stuff after one interval set in html has lasted.
